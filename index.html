<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi. I recently finished an undergrad and honours year in CS and Neuroscience at UNSW. I’m interested in doing research on <a href="https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-week-2">AI Alignment</a>, to reduce the risk of things going badly when someone works out how to build smarter-than-human AI. My other interests include bouldering and hiking and reading and movies.</p>
<p>I’m making this site to serve as a portfolio/resume type thing, even though I don’t have much to put on it yet. Hopefully it will motivate me to make things and do things.</p>

<li>Honours Thesis: <a href="./thesis.pdf">On the Algorithmic Hypothesis Class
Complexity of Deep Neural Networks</a>
<ul>
<li>This project was an attempt to prove a generalisation bound on a two-layer neural network (under a lot of assumptions). The project was a success but the main result is fairly trivial. I learned a lot about current research on the question of why neural networks generalize well despite being massively overparameterized. The literature review is mostly about this problem.</li>

<ul>
<li>2020-2021 Tutoring and Admin for <a href="https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2019/COMP9418">COMP9418</a>. In this role I designed an assignment, and rewrote all the tutorial code to make it cleaner and object oriented. The tutorial code each week builds up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model">PGM</a> library that the students then use in the assignments and final exam. Student feedback for me can be found <a href="/student_feedback.html">here</a>.</li>
